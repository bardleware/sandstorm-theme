# **Sandstorm Color Theme**
### _A theme for working late into the night_

A few nights ago, I realized how it might be nice to have a theme that didn't have a bluey tint but also didn't burn your eyes out with how much red there was. The result of which is the Sandstorm color theme. Its like that one song that's played at youth gatherings where you get this over-inflated notion that you can do anything in the world...except that now the thing is program late into the night and it's no longer and over-inflated notion.

I am open to tweaks and adjustments to make the theme better.
